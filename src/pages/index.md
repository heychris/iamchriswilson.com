I'm a programmer with a reputation for user-centered, detail-oriented work. I love reading, music, and quiet evenings with my wife. (When I'm lucky I have all three.)

Currently buried under a foot of snow in Minnesota and
working at [InVision](https://invisionapp.com).

You can contact me via email at hello@iamchriswilson.com. Around the internet you can find me at [Github](https://github.com/heychris 'Github'), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/heychris 'CodePen'), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherwilson3/ 'LinkedIn').
