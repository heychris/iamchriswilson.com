## Developer working with web tech

I'm a developer currently working with most of the web
stack. I love reading, music, and quiet evenings with my wife.
(When I'm lucky I have all three.)

For almost a decade, I have built websites and completed
web projects. Although I use a lot of different tools, my core
focus remains on JavaScript, CSS, and PHP.

Currently buried under a foot of snow in Minnesota and
working at [MVP Marketing + Design](https://mvpdesign.com).

You can contact me via email at hello@iamchriswilson.com.
